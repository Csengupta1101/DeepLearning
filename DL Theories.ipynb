    "* Neurons are the center point\n",
    "* Dendrites are the reciever of signal for the neuron\n",
    "* Axon is the transmitter of signal for the neuron\n",
    "* Dendrites of one neuron is connected with axon of other neurons \n",
    "* Signal from one neuron passes from it's axon and is recived by other neuron's dendrites , this is how transmission happen.\n",
    "* While transmitting the axon deosn't really touch the dendrites , and this transmission point is called Synapse.\n",
    "* In Machine learning The neuron gets the input from multiple inpur layers\n",
    "* These input layers are neurons as well \n",
    "* The point of receiving the input is called Synapse as described above\n",
    "* All the input layers are independent variables\n",
    "* Before processing the input layers to the neuron , we need to standardize/normalize them\n",
    "* All the input variables here are of the same record. meaning for a single person's details the input variables can be his age , salary etc etc but in the end the input is for that person only\n",
    "* Same way the output variable also stays for only one record only.\n",
    "* Output variable can be continuous/binary/categorical(more than two)\n",
    "* Every single input variable when being transmitted to the neuron via synapse is assigned a weight (similar to co efficient)\n",
    "* This weight determines which signal/input is more important than others\n",
    "* Once the signal is passed from the input variables to the Neuron , neuron does two things\n",
    "    -   Calculate and stores the wighted sum of the input vraibles\n",
    "    -   Perform activation function in these variable's weighte sum."
